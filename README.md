This project is an ISO challenge, the second one of the security branch at 42 School. It focuses on `binary exploitation`, `stack overflows`, `format string vulnerabilities`, `GOT/PLT overwrites`, `shellcode injection`, `heap exploitation`, `environment variable tricks`.

### Project Structure

- `level0/` to `level9/` : main levels, each with a `walkthrough.md` and a `flag` file containing the password for the next level.
- `bonus0/` to `bonus3/` : bonus levels, with their own walkthroughs and flags.
- Each `walkthrough.md` explains the vulnerability, the exploitation steps, and the commands used to solve the level.

### Example Level Structure

```
levelX/
  ├── flag            # password for the next level
  └── walkthrough.md  # step-by-step solution
```
